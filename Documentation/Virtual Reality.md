# Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality (VR) headsets are devices worn on your head that provide an immersive experience of a simulated 3D virtual environment. VR displays 3D environments 
using a combination of hardware and software. The hardware component of a VR headset consists of two small screens and lenses placed in front of each eye, which 
create a stereoscopic image. These 3D environments are rendered twice, once for each screen, at slightly different positions to produce stereoscopic vision.

VR headsets fit into one of two categories, either standalone VR headsets which are made with a built-in graphics possessing unit and processor or more powerful 
headsets that need to be connected to a computer. The Meta Quest 2, which is used in this work, was designed to be a standalone VR headset, however it can still be 
connected to a computer. Connecting the Quest 2 to a computer gives greater control over what can be displayed to the headset. 

Since the interest is running psychophysical experiments using VR and stereoscopic images, a program must be designed to run the experiments and display the images. 
To make a program for VR, first a development platform needs to be chosen. There are several platforms available for developing VR apps, like game engines such as 
Unity or Unreal Engine.
