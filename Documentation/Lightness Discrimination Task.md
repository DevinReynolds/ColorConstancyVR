# Lightness Discrimination Task
Similar to the previous monitor experiment, two stereoscopic pairs are shown to the subject and they report on which image they think contains the lighter 
target object. Four images, two stereoscopic pairs, in total are displayed but the pairs appear as a single image when viewed through the headset. Of 
these two pairs, one is called a standard image and the other is called the comparison image. The target object of the standard image has a fixed lightness 
value of 0.40, while the target object of the comparison image has one of 11 linearly spaced lightness values between 0.35 and 0.45. The pairs are displayed 
consecutively for 0.25 seconds each. The inter-trial interval and inter-stimulus interval are both 0.25 seconds. 

The scripts used to run the task are written in C#. Any scripts must be attached to objects inside of the scene to be run. Those scripts will be ran when the 
object they are attached to is loaded inside of the scene. The scripts used in this set-up are [Main.cs](/Main.cs), [Manage.cs](/Manage.cs), and 
[runAquisitionBySubjectName.cs](runAquisitionBySubjectName.cs).
