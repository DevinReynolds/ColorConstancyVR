## Image Importing

Before using the project the images must be imported into the unity folder. The default for this is 
UnityProject\Assets\Resources\Conditions where conditions is populated with folders containing only the images generated. 

To change this, modify lines 39, 40, 48, and 49 of Main.cs.
