Experment to study the effect of variation in target object extrinsic properties of a visual scene on lightness discrimination thresholds. This repository deals with displaying the computer rendered images and collecting subject response. The code used to render the images can be found [here](https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldColorConstancy). This is a virtual reality representation of a similar flat monitor experiment found [here](https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldPsychophysics).
