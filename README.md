# ColorConstancyVR

Experment to study the effect of variation in target object extrinsic properties of a visual scene on lightness discrimination thresholds. This project utilizes Unity's editor to display [rendered](https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldColorConstancy) stereo-pair images of a naturalistic scene containing an achromatic sphere to a virtual reality headset. Sets of stereo-pair images are displayed to a human subject and the subject reports which image contains the lighter sphere. This is a virtual reality implementation of a similar [monitor experiment](https://github.com/BrainardLab/VirtualWorldPsychophysics).
